## Welcome to MATH 1206: Calculus I! 

**Course description:** This calculus course is intended for science and math majors. Topics include limits; continuity; intermediate value theorem; derivatives; mean value theorem; applications such as curve sketching, optimization, related rates, linear approximation, and differentials; antiderivatives; Riemann sums; definite integrals; the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus; substitution rule; inverse functions and their derivatives; and logarithmic and exponential functions. 

Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.

**Textbook:** James Stewart, Daniel K. Clegg, and Saleem Watson's "Calculus", 9th edition.

**Lecture Instructor:** Dr. Asimina Hamakiotes
