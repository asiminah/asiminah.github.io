The information in this post may vary for different schools. 

What are the PhD qualifying exams? Depending on the school, within the first 1-2 years, PhD candidates are expected to take typically 2-3 written exams in core areas (such as topology, algebra, analysis) and demonstrate proficiency. At UConn, these exams are about 6-7 problems and last 4 hours.
