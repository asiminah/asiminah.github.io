## Welcome to MATH 2011: Programming for Math and Science! 

**Course description:** This course focuses on Python programming and scripting of algorithms coming from basic linear algebra. Students develop their own implementations that form the basis of many computational methods. The course is accessible to students in mathematics and the physical, social, and computer sciences. 

Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.

**Prerequisite:** MATH 1206 (Calculus I).

**Textbook:** TBD

**Class:** Monday’s and Wednesday’s at 11:30AM-12:45PM in TBD.

**Recitations:** Monday’s at 1-1:50PM in TBD.

**Lecture Instructor:** Dr. Asimina Hamakiotes
* Contact: [ahamakiotes@fordham.edu](mailto:ahamakiotes@fordham.edu)
* Office: LL817F
* Office Hours: TBD in LL817F

**Math Help Room:** Additional help (outside of the lecturer and recitation leader's office hours) can be found in the Math Help Room without making an appointment. The Math Help Room is staffed by math professors and undergraduate tutors during some time blocks between 9:00AM and 5:00PM from Monday's through Friday's. The Math Help Room is located in LL810 or LL812, depending on the time. The schedule for the Math Help Room can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wsv5_7K1RqCxhUKb1pK7cAbDEN3-wKskBAVeQ6CLcCs/edit?gid=98745945#gid=98745945). 

EVERYTHING BELOW NEEDS TO BE EDITED FOR MATH 2011. 

### Class structure

This class meets twice a week for lecture and once a week for recitation. Towards the bottom of this page, I have posted the tentative class schedule for the semester. I have written out which sections and topics of the textbook I plan to cover each class. 

**Attendance:** In the beginning of every class attendance will be taken. It is important to attend all classes since each class in this course will build off of the previous one. More than three unexcused absences will result in a significant lowering of your grade. If you know in advance that you will not be able to attend class or that you will arrive late, then email the instructor in advance. 

**Homework:** For homework, we will use the online platform called MathMatize, which the math department provides for students at no cost. Each homework will be on the sections covered that week and is due on Sunday's at 11:59PM. The homeworks will be light and are just meant to make sure you are understanding the material we are going over in class and to help you prepare for the quiz. All late homeworks will recieve a 0. 

**Midterms:** There will be two midterms. Midterm 1 is on Wed. 10/8 and Midterm 2 is on Wed. 11/19. We will have review sessions in class on Monday the week of the exam. There will be no make-up exams unless.

**Final exam:** The final exam will be cummulative and during finals week. The final exam schedule is in the table below. No make-ups will be given unless for a reason approved by the Dean of Students.

**Grading:** The course grade will be composed of homework, quizzes, two midterms, and a final exam. The breakdown will be as follows: 

| Course Component |       | Weight    | 
| :----:           | :---: |  :----:   |    
| Homework         |       |  15%      |
| Labs             |       |  20%      | 
| Midterm          |       |  20%      | 
| Final exam       |       |  30%      | 


(All grades and assignments will be posted on Blackboard.) 

<!--
**Exams:** 
* **Midterm 1:** Oct. 8, 2025
* **Midterm 2:** Nov. 19, 2025
* **Final:** TBD
-->


**Make-up policy:** No make-up exams will be given after the exam date. If you know that you will miss an exam and have a good excuse, then you must let the instructor know in advance. You must follow the university's policy on excused absences. In case of illness or other emergency on an exam date, contact the instructor by email as soon as possible so that appropriate arrangements can be made.

**Academic Integrity Statement:** This course expects all students to act in accordance with the [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.fordham.edu/resources/policies/academic-integrity-policy/) at Fordham University. Because questions of intellectual property are important to the field of this course, we will discuss academic honesty as a topic and not just a policy. If you have questions about academic integrity or intellectual property, you should consult with your instructor. 

**Students with Disabilities:** If you would like to request accommodations due to a documented disability, please contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS) as soon as possible. The ODS will then let the instructor know what types of accommodations should be provided (but not the nature of the disability). You are also encouraged to let the instructor know any aspects of the course that are not easily accessible to you so that the instructor can provide any appropriate support. The ODS is located at LL408 and can be reached by email at [disabilityservices@fordham.edu](mailto:disabilityservices@fordham.edu). Accommodations are NOT retroactive, so you need to register with ODS prior to receiving your accommodations.
