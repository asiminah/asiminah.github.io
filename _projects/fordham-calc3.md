## Welcome to MATH 2008: Vector Calculus! 

**Course description:** Topics include the algebra and analytic geometry of three-dimensional vectors, tangent lines and arc length of parameterized curves, continuity and differentiability of functions of several variables, tangent planes and area of surfaces, gradients, chain rule, max/min values, Lagrange multipliers, iterated integrals, change of variables in multiple integrals, the theorems of Green and Stokes, and the Divergence Theorem. 

Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.
