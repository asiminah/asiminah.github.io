## Welcome to MATH 2008: Vector Calculus! 

**Course description:** Topics include the algebra and analytic geometry of three-dimensional vectors, tangent lines and arc length of parameterized curves, continuity and differentiability of functions of several variables, tangent planes and area of surfaces, gradients, chain rule, max/min values, Lagrange multipliers, iterated integrals, change of variables in multiple integrals, the theorems of Green and Stokes, and the Divergence Theorem. 

Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.

**Prerequisites:** MATH 1207 (Calulus II).

**Textbook:** James Stewart, Daniel K. Clegg, and Saleem Watson's "Calculus", 9th edition.

**Class:** Monday's and Thursday's at 2:30-3:45PM in TBD. 

**Lecture Instructor:** Dr. Asimina Hamakiotes

### Class structure

**Homework:** For homework, we will use the online platform called MathMatize, which the math department provides for students at no cost. Homework is due ...

**Quizzes:** There will be weekly quizzes in the beginning of every recitation. Each quiz will be on the previous weeks material, so each quiz will be on material that was covered in the last homework. Each quiz will consist of two problems and will take place in the first 10 minutes of the recitation. Quizzes will be graded out of 10 points.

**Grading:** The course grade will be composed of quizzes, homework, two midterms, and a final exam. The breakdown will be as follows: 

| Course Component |       | Weight    | 
| :----:           | :---: |  :----:   |   
| Quizzes       |       |  15%      |  
| Homework         |       |  15%      |
| Midterm 1   |       |  20%      | 
| Midterm 2     |       |  20%      | 
| Final exam       |       |  30%      | 


(All grades and assignments will be posted on Blackboard.) 


**Exams:** 
* **Midterm 1:** Oct. 9, 2025
* **Midterm 2:** Nov. 20, 2025
* **Final:** TBD

**Academic Integrity Statement:** This course expects all students to act in accordance with the [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.fordham.edu/resources/policies/academic-integrity-policy/) at Fordham University. Because questions of intellectual property are important to the field of this course, we will discuss academic honesty as a topic and not just a policy. If you have questions about academic integrity or intellectual property, you should consult with your instructor.
