## Welcome to MATH 2210Q: Applied Linear Algebra! 

**Course description:** Systems of equations, matrices, determinants, linear transformations on vector spaces, characteristic values and vectors, from a computational point of view. The course is an introduction to the techniques of linear algebra with elementary applications.

**Prerequisites:** MATH 1132Q (Calulus II), MATH 1152Q (Honors Calculus II), or MATH 2142Q (Advanced Calculus II).

**Textbook:** David C. Lay's "Linear Algebra and Its Application", 6th edition. 

**Classes:** Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3:30-4:45PM in FSB 102.

**Office hours:** TBD.


### Class structure



**Video lectures:** The video lectures are available at [this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJgq70ZWtrVIwHEDYdj-kdg/playlists). If you have trouble accessing the YouTube channel, then you can also view the video lectures [here](https://kaltura.uconn.edu/channel/Math%2B2210Q/168885461) on UConn's Kaltura server. 

**Grading:** The course grade will be composed of a final exam, two midterms, quizzes, worksheets, and homework. The breakdown will be as follows: 


| Course Component |       | Weight    | 
| :----:           | :---: |  :----:   |   
| Final exam       |       |  25%      | 
| Midterms (2)     |       |  20%      | 
| Quizzes          |       |  15%      |
| Worksheets       |       |  10%      |  
| Homework         |       |  10%      |

**HuskyCT:** All grades and announcements will be posted on HuskyCT.  

**Quizzes:** There will be weekly quizzes. 

**Worksheets:** Worksheets will be posted on HuskyCT. There will be a worksheet for each section we cover that consists of basic problems, which you will be working on collaboratively with others during classtime. Worksheets are due on HuskyCT by 11:59pm on Monday of the following week and are graded for completion. Solutions will be posted on HuskyCT the following day. 

**Homework:** There will be weekly homework on MyMathLab. 

**Midterms:** There will be two midterms. Dates TBD. 

**Final exam:** The final exam will be cummulative and during finals week.

<!-- 

Quizzes will be weekly (2 random homework problems)

Homework will be about 10 problems per week on MyMathLab (3-4 per section we cover that week)

I will do a mostly flipped classroom style. A little bit of lecture plus problem solving session/working on worksheets. 
I will do more lecture on the days we are covering harder sections.
