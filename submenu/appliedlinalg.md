## Welcome to MATH 2210Q: Applied Linear Algebra! 

**Course description:** Systems of equations, matrices, determinants, linear transformations on vector spaces, characteristic values and vectors, from a computational point of view. The course is an introduction to the techniques of linear algebra with elementary applications.

**Prerequisites:** MATH 1132Q (Calulus II), MATH 1152Q (Honors Calculus II), or MATH 2142Q (Advanced Calculus II).

**Textbook:** David C. Lay's "Linear Algebra and Its Application", 4th edition. 

**Classes:** Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3:30-4:45PM in FSB 102.

**Office hours:** TBD.


### Class structure

**Grading:** The course grade will be composed of a final exam, two midterms, quizzes, worksheets, and homework. The breakdown will be as follows: 

| Course Component |       | Weight    | 
| :----:           | :---: |  :----:   |   
| Final exam       |       |  25%      |

**Video lectures:**

**Quizzes:** There will be weekly quizzes. 

**Worksheets:** There will be a worksheet for each section we cover. Worksheets will mostly be completed in class. 

**Homework:** There will be weekly homework on MyMathLab. 

<!-- 

Final will be cummulative and during finals week

Two midterms 

Quizzes will be weekly (2 random homework problems)

Worksheets will be mostly done in class

Homework will be about 10 problems per week on MyMathLab (3-4 per section we cover that week)

I will do a mostly flipped classroom style. A little bit of lecture plus problem solving session/working on worksheets. 
I will do more lecture on the days we are covering harder sections.
