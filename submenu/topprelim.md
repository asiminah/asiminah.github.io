I am the algebra prelim tutor for summer 2023! (I was also the algebra prelim tutor for winter 2022). 

A good first place to start studying is [UConn's past algebra prelims](https://math.uconn.edu/degree-programs/graduate/preliminary-exams/). Another good resource is Jeremy Teitelbaum's [course webage](https://jeremy9959.net/Math-5210/overview.html). 

For general information on how to study for prelims, you can read [this](https://asiminah.github.io/projects/quals/) blog post. 

**Past prelims:**
