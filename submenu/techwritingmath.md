## Welcome to MATH 2705W: Technical Writing in Math! 

**Course description:** An introduction to the communication of mathematics through formal writing.

**Prerequisites:** ENGL 1007 or 1010 or 1011 or 2011, and MATH 1132Q or 2141Q; completion of or concurrent enrollment in either MATH 2110Q, 2142Q, 2210Q, or 2410Q; open only to Mathematics majors.

**Textbook:** Although there is no textbook required for this course, we suggest “Mathematical Writing” by Franco Vivaldi (Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series, 2014th Edition) as a valuable resource for this class.

**Class:** Mondays at 10:10-11:00AM in MONT 113. 

**Office hours:** TBD. 
<!-- Tuesdays and Thursdays at 2:15-3:15PM on webex. You can access my webex link through HuskyCT. -->


### Class structure

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Write about mathematics clearly, using correct grammar, in a well-organized manner.
2. Acquire basic skills in $$\LaTeX$$. 
3. Discuss mathematical ideas and results in a clear and concise manner that is understood by others.
4. Understand your audience: who is the reader of your mathematical piece?
5. Explain a proof in a manner that is easily understood by a reader.
6. Use clear and appropriate examples to explain ideas and illustrate points.
7. Develop documents and presentations that effectively and correctly communicate mathematical ideas.

Towards the bottom of this page, I have posted the complete class schedule for the semester. I have written out which sections and topics I plan to cover each class and what the corresponding video lectures are for those sections. Each week we will cover about three sections of the textbook. Each section may have 1-2 corresponding video lectures that you will need to watch in advance before class in order to be able to complete the worksheets. 

**HuskyCT:** All announcements related to the course will be posted on HuskyCT. Assignments and grades will be posted on HuskyCT as well. 

**Grading:** The course grade will be composed of worksheets, homework, quizzes, two midterms, and a final exam. The breakdown will be as follows: 

| Course Component |       | Weight    | 
| :----:           | :---: |  :----:   |   
| Worksheets       |       |  10%      |  
| Homework         |       |  10%      |
| Quizzes          |       |  15%      |
| Midterms (2)     |       |  20%      | 
| Final exam       |       |  25%      | 


(All grades and assignments will be posted on HuskyCT.) 


**Homework:** There will be weekly homework on MyMathLab through HuskyCT. Each homework will be on the sections covered that week. Homework is due Monday at 11:59PM of the following week. The homeworks will be light and are just meant to make sure you are understanding the exercises you are doing in class and to help you prepare for the quiz. 


**Final exam:** There is no final exam for this course.

**Student conduct code:** Students are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with UConn’s [Student Conduct Code](https://community.uconn.edu/the-student-code/).

**Academic Integrity Statement:** This course expects all students to act in accordance with the Guidelines for Academic Integrity at the University of Connecticut. Because questions of intellectual property are important to the field of this course, we will discuss academic honesty as a topic and not just a policy. If you have questions about academic integrity or intellectual property, you should consult with your instructor. Additionally, consult UConn’s [guidelines for academic integrity](https://community.uconn.edu/the-student-code-appendix-a/).

**Students with Disabilities:** The University of Connecticut is committed to protecting the rights of individuals with disabilities and assuring that the learning environment is accessible. If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability or pregnancy, please let me know immediately so that we can discuss options. Students who require accommodations should contact the Center for Students with Disabilities, Wilbur Cross Building Room 204, (860)486-2020, or http://csd.uconn.edu/.

**Final Exam Policy:** In accordance with UConn policy, students are required to be available for their final exam and/or complete any assessment during the time stated. If you have a conflict with this time you must obtain official permission to schedule a make-up exam with the [Dean of Students](http://dos.uconn.edu/). If permission is granted, the Dean of Students will notify the instructor. Please note that vacations, previously purchased tickets or reservations, graduations, social events, misreading the assessment schedule, and oversleeping are not viable reasons for rescheduling a final.
