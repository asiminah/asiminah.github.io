I have not been the complex analysis prelim tutor before, but I have taken the complex analysis prelim. Here I have shared all of my past prelim solutions from when I was studying. Hopefully this will be helpful to all of you who are studying for this prelim. 

A good first place to start studying is [UConn's past complex analysis prelims](https://math.uconn.edu/degree-programs/graduate/preliminary-exams/). For general information or advice on how to study for prelims, you can read [this](https://asiminah.github.io/projects/quals/) blog post.
