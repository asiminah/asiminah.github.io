I am the algebra prelim tutor for winter 2022! 

A good first place to start studying is [UConn's past algebra prelims](https://math.uconn.edu/degree-programs/graduate/preliminary-exams/). Another good resource is Jeremy Teitelbaum's [course webage](https://jeremy9959.net/Math-5210/overview.html). 

Although the course text that is always recommended for this prelim and used in class is Dummit and Foote, I have found it extremely helpful to read through Keith Conrad's [expository papers](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/) on various related prelim topics. For example, if you are struggling with semi-direct products (which are on the prelim syllabus), Keith has [this](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/grouptheory/semidirect-product.pdf) great paper that you can read in order to get a better understanding of what is going on. 

For general information on how to study for prelims, you can read [this](https://asiminah.github.io/projects/quals/) blog post.
