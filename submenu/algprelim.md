I am the algebra prelim tutor for winter 2022! 

A good first place to start studying is [UConn's past algebra prelims](https://math.uconn.edu/degree-programs/graduate/preliminary-exams/). Another good resource is Jeremy Teitelbaum's [course webage](https://jeremy9959.net/Math-5210/overview.html). 

Although the course text that is always recommended for this prelim and used in class is Dummit and Foote, I have found it extremely helpful to read through Keith Conrad's [expository papers](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/) on various related prelim topics. For example, if you are struggling with semi-direct products (which are on the prelim syllabus), Keith has [this](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/grouptheory/semidirect-product.pdf) great paper that you can read in order to get a better understanding of what is going on. 

For general information on how to study for prelims, you can read [this](https://asiminah.github.io/projects/quals/) blog post. 

**Here are the notes from the tutoring sessions:**
* Session one, <a href="/assets/pdf/AlgJan2021.pdf" target="_blank">notes</a> ([Jan. 2021 prelim](https://math.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2511/2021/05/jan2021alg.pdf))
* Session two, <a href="/assets/pdf/AlgAug2020.pdf" target="_blank">notes1</a> ([Aug. 2020 prelim](https://math.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2511/2020/11/aug2020alg.pdf)), <a href="/assets/pdf/AlgJan2020.pdf" target="_blank">notes2</a> ([Jan. 2020 prelim](https://math.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2511/2020/05/jan2020alg.pdf))
* Session three, <a href="/assets/pdf/AlgAug2019.pdf" target="_blank">notes</a> ([Aug. 2019 prelim](https://math.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2511/2019/08/aug2019alg.pdf))
* Session four, <a href="/assets/pdf/AlgJan2019.pdf" target="_blank">notes</a> ([Jan. 2019 prelim](https://math.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2511/2019/07/jan2019alg.pdf)) 
* Session five, <a href="/assets/pdf/AlgAug2018.pdf" target="_blank">notes</a> ([Aug. 2018 prelim](https://math.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2511/2018/12/aug2018alg.pdf)) 
* Session six, <a href="/assets/pdf/AlgJan2018.pdf" target="_blank">notes1</a> ([Jan. 2018 prelim](https://math.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2511/2018/12/jan2018alg.pdf)), ([Aug. 2017 prelim](https://math.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2511/2018/12/aug2017alg.pdf))



**Here are some random notes of things that were helpful for me when I was studying:**
* <a href="/assets/pdf/GeneralNotes.pdf" target="_blank">General (brief) overview</a>. This has most, but not all, important definitions and theorems. 
* <a href="/assets/pdf/GpActionThms.pdf" target="_blank">Theorems with group actions on finite groups</a>. It is good and helpful to know the proofs of these, or at least to memorize the main tools used in the proofs. 
* <a href="/assets/pdf/RingTheory.pdf" target="_blank">Ring theory</a>. This has a lot of useful theorems and proofs, some of which have appeared on past prelims, but this is not exhaustive of all the ring theory material. 
* <a href="/assets/pdf/LinAlgProblems.pdf" target="_blank">Linear algebra problems</a>. This has linear algebra problems/solutions from past homeworks and exams from when I took the course.
