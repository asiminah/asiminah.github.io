I am the algebra prelim tutor for winter 2022! A good first place to start is [UConn's past algebra prelims](https://math.uconn.edu/degree-programs/graduate/preliminary-exams/).

For general information on how to study for prelims, you can read [this](https://asiminah.github.io/projects/quals/) blog post.
