I am the algebra prelim tutor for winter 2022! 

A good first place to start studying is [UConn's past algebra prelims](https://math.uconn.edu/degree-programs/graduate/preliminary-exams/).

Another good resource is Jeremy Teitelbaum's [course webage](https://jeremy9959.net/Math-5210/overview.html).  

For general information on how to study for prelims, you can read [this](https://asiminah.github.io/projects/quals/) blog post.
