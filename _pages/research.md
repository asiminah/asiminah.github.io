My interests are in number theory and algebra, specifically, arithmetic geometry and algebraic number theory. 

I am currently working on a project with [John Cullinan](http://faculty.bard.edu/cullinan/about.html) and [Gabrielle Scullard](https://science.psu.edu/math/people/gns49) from the [Rethinking Number Theory 3 Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/rethinkingnumbertheory/home?authuser=0).
