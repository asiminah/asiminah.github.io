My research interests are in arithmetic geometry and algebraic number theory. I am interested in studying elliptic curves and Galois representations. My advisor is [√Ålvaro Lozano-Robledo](https://alozano.clas.uconn.edu/). 

In the summer of 2022, I participated in the [Rethinking Number Theory 3 Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/rethinkingnumbertheory-3/home?authuser=0). Let $$E$$ and $$E'$$ be $$2$$-isogenous elliptic curves defined over $$\mathbb{Q}$$. For our project, we were interested in studying the proportion of primes $$p$$ for which $$E(\mathbb{F}_p)\cong E'(\mathbb{F}_p)$$ and $$E(\mathbb{F}_{p^2}) \not\cong E'(\mathbb{F}_{p^2})$$. When this happens, we call $$p$$ anomalous. There has been previous work done on this by John Cullinan and Nathan Kaplan (see [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09176)). In our project, we complete the classification begun in [1]. We give an explicit formula for the proportion of anomalous primes, depending on the images $$G$$ and $$G'$$ of the $$2$$-adic representations of $$E$$ and $$E'$$, respectively. We consider both the non-CM and CM case. 

<!--I am currently working on computing the proportion of sneaky primes for pairs of elliptic curves (both non-CM and CM) with [John Cullinan](http://faculty.bard.edu/cullinan/about.html) and [Gabrielle Scullard](https://science.psu.edu/math/people/gns49).  -->

In fall 2019 to spring 2020, I worked on my undergraduate honors thesis with [Andrew Obus](http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/aobus/). In my honors thesis, we calculated the probability that the gcd of a pair of quadratic integers $$n,m$$ chosen randomly, uniformly, and independently from the set of quadratic integers of norm $$x$$ or less, is $$k$$. We also calculated the expected norm of the gcd( $$n,m$$ ) as $$x$$ tends to infinity, with explicit error terms. We determined the probability and expected norm of the gcd for quadratic integer rings that are UFDs. We also outlined a method to determine the probability and expected norm of the gcd of elements in quadratic integer rings that are not UFDs. 


In the summer of 2019, I participated in the NSF REU at Texas A&M University. In our research project, we proved that the crank partition function is asymptotically equidistributed modulo $$Q$$, for any odd number $$Q$$. To prove this, we obtained effective bounds on the error term from Zapata Rolon's asymptotic estimate for the crank function. We then used those bounds to prove the surjectivity and strict log-subadditivity of the crank function. This was joint work with [Wei-Lun Tsai](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/wei-lun-tsai) and Aaron Kreigman. 


In the summer of 2018, I participated in the NSF REU at Oregon State University. In our research project, we showed that eta-quotients which are modular for any congruence subgroup of level $$N$$ coprime to 6 can be viewed as modular for $$\Gamma_0(N)$$. We then categorized when even weight eta-quotients can exist in $$M_k(\Gamma_1(p))$$ and $$M_k(\Gamma_1(pq))$$, for distinct primes $$p,q$$. We also provided some new examples of elliptic curves whose corresponding modular forms can be written as a linear combination of eta-quotients, and we described an algorithmic method for finding additional examples. This was joint work with [Holly Swisher](https://sites.google.com/view/hollyswisher/home), [Michael Allen](https://michaelgallen.com/), Nicholas Anderson, and Benjamin Oltsik.
