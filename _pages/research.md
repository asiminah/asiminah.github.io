My research interests are in arithmetic geometry and algebraic number theory. I am interested in studying elliptic curves and Galois representations. My advisor is [√Ålvaro Lozano-Robledo](https://alozano.clas.uconn.edu/). 

I am currently working on computing the proportion of sneaky primes for pairs of elliptic curves (both non-CM and CM) with [John Cullinan](http://faculty.bard.edu/cullinan/about.html) and [Gabrielle Scullard](https://science.psu.edu/math/people/gns49).  

My senior year of undergrad (fall 2019 - spring 2020), I wrote 

In the summer of 2019, I participated in the NSF REU at Texas A&M University. 

In the summer of 2018, I participated in the NSF REU at Oregon State University. In our research project, we showed that eta-quotients which are modular for any congruence subgroup of level $$N$$ coprime to 6 can be viewed as modular for $$\Gamma_0(N)$$. We then categorized when even weight eta-quotients can exist in $$M_k(\Gamma_1(p))$$ and $$M_k(\Gamma_1(pq))$$, for distinct primes $$p,q$$. We alsp provided some new examples of elliptic curves whose corresponding modular forms can be written as a linear combination of eta-quotients, and we described an algorithmic method for finding additional examples.
