My research interests are in arithmetic geometry and algebraic number theory. I am interested in studying elliptic curves and Galois representations. My advisor is [√Ålvaro Lozano-Robledo](https://alozano.clas.uconn.edu/). 

I am currently working on computing the proportion of sneaky primes for pairs of elliptic curves (both non-CM and CM) with [John Cullinan](http://faculty.bard.edu/cullinan/about.html) and [Gabrielle Scullard](https://science.psu.edu/math/people/gns49).
