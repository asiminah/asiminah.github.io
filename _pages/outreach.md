I often give talks to the [UConn Math Club](https://mathclub.math.uconn.edu/) for undergrads. I have also been on panels about applying to Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) and applying to grad school. 
* In Spring 2025, I gave a talk on "Opportunities at the NSA".
* In Fall 2024, I gave a talk on "How many ways can you sum $$1 + 2 + \cdots + n$$?". 
* In Fall 2023, I gave a talk on the "Infinitude of the Primes".
* In Spring 2023, I gave a talk on "Sums of Powers by L'Hopital's Rule". 
* In Fall 2022, I gave a talk on "Computationally Hard Problems and Their Uses in Cryptography". 

I helped organize the [Mathematics Continued Conference (MCC)](https://mcc.math.uconn.edu/) in fall 2022. The MCC is a one-day conference aimed to give undergrads interested in math an idea of what grad school is like and to showcase some current (accessible) math research done by grad students and faculty members. There is also a poster session for undergrads to display their research. There is also a panel discussion led by grad students with varying backgrounds (different years, different fields, international students, Masters students, PhD students) on what the transition to grad school is like and they offer insight on the application process. 

I am a mentor in the [Directed Reading Program (DRP)](https://math.uconn.edu/degree-programs/undergraduate/directed-reading-program/) at UConn. 
* In Fall 2024, I mentored a student through reading "Number Theory and Geometry: An Introduction to Arithmetic Geometry", by Álvaro Lozano-Robledo.
* In Spring 2023, I mentored a student through reading "An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography", by Jeffrey Hoffstein, Jill Pipher, and Joseph H. Silverman.
* In spring 2022, I mentored a student through reading "Elliptic Curves, Modular Forms, and Their L-Functions", by Álvaro Lozano-Robledo.
