My name is Asimina and I am a second year mathematics PhD student at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/). I am supported by the [Graduate Fellowship for STEM Diversity (GFSD)](https://stemfellowships.org/). My interests are in number theory and algebra, specifically, arithmetic geometry and algebraic number theory. My advisor is [√Ålvaro Lozano-Robledo](https://alozano.clas.uconn.edu/). 

In Spring 2020, I graduated from [Macaulay Honors](https://macaulay.cuny.edu/) at [Baruch College (CUNY)](https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/) with a BA in Mathematics and minors in Philosophy and Interdisciplinary studies of New York. In Fall 2017, I placed second at the [Traders@MIT](https://traders.mit.edu/#about) competition (the largest intercollegiate algorithmic trading competition in the country). In Spring 2019, I worked in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with [Group One Trading](https://group1.com/) as a Trade Analyst Intern. In the summer of 2018, I participated in the NSF funded [number theory REU at Oregon State University](http://sites.science.oregonstate.edu/math_reu/index.html) and was advised by Holly Swisher. In Spring 2019, I studied abroad in [Budapest Semesters in Mathematics (BSM)](https://www.budapestsemesters.com/). In the summer of 2019, I participated in the NSF funded [number theory REU at Texas A&M University](https://www.math.tamu.edu/undergraduate/research/REU/) and was advised by Riad Masri. My senior year, I was the first student at Baruch to write an honors thesis in math, and was advised by Andrew Obus. 

I have a 2 year old female German Shepherd named Athena. In my free time, I like to do Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I also enjoy swimming, going on walks/hikes, and listening to music.
