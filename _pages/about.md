My name is Asimina and I am a second year mathematics PhD student at the University of Connecticut. My interests are in number theory and algebra, specifically, arithmetic geometry and algebraic number theory. My advisor is √Ålvaro Lozano-Robledo. 

I graduated from Macaulay Honors at Baruch College (CUNY) with a BA in Mathematics and a minor in Philosophy and Interdisciplinary studies of New York. I studied abroad in Budapest Semesters in Mathematics (BSM). I participated in the 2018 NSF funded number theory REU at Oregon State University and the 2018 NSF funded number theory REU at Texas A&M University. 

I have a 19 month old female German Shepherd named Athena. In my free time, I like to do Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
