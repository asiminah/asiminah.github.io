**MATH 3710 Mathematical Modeling:**

Summer 2022 I was apart of a CLAS Course Improvement Mini Grant with [David T. McArdle](https://david-mcardle.scholar.uconn.edu/). The goal was to create a modular, inquiry-based modeling course. In particular, the learning objectives of the modules were to have the students 
* demonstrate an understanding of how mathematical models can be implemented in various STEM fields, 
* apply mathematical techniques from calculus, differential equations, and discrete mathematics to create and analyze models, and
* communicate solutions to mathematical modeling problems through the use of presentations and expository writing.

As a result, I designed the following 2-week module on a climate model: the energy balance model. Here is the <a href="/assets/pdf/MATH3710_Climate_GroupActivity.pdf" target="_blank">self-guided (group) activity</a> that the students are expected to complete in the first week and here is the <a href="/assets/pdf/Video_assignment.pdf" target="_blank">video assignment</a> that the students are expected to complete in the second week.
