<!-- For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course. -->
**Courses:**
* Spring 2023: [MATH 2210Q Applied Linear Algebra](https://asiminah.github.io/appliedlinalg/) (Instructor)
* Fall 2022: MATH 1020Q Problem Solving (Instructor)
* Spring 2022: MATH 1132Q Calculus II (TA)

**Students mentored through UConn's [Directed Reading Program (DRP)](https://math.uconn.edu/degree-programs/undergraduate/directed-reading-program/):**
* Spring 2022: Sierra Woods, project on elliptic curves (<a href="/assets/pdf/Elliptic_Curves_FINAL_PRESENTATION.pdf" target="_blank">presentation</a>)

**MATH 3710 Mathematical Modeling:**

Summer 2022 I was apart of a CLAS Course Improvement Mini Grant with [David T. McArdle](https://david-mcardle.scholar.uconn.edu/). The goal was to create a modular, inquiry-based modeling course. In particular, the learning objectives of the modules were to have the students 
* demonstrate an understanding of how mathematical models can be implemented in various STEM  elds, 
* apply mathematical techniques from calculus, differential equations, and discrete mathematics to create and analyze models, and
* communicate solutions to mathematical modeling problems through the use of presentations and expository writing.
